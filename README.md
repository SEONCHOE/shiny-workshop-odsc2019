# Shiny Workshop - Open Data Science Conference 2019

In this workshop, we'll be using [data](https://www.kaggle.com/schmadam97/nba-regular-season-stats-20182019) from the NBA 2018/19 season to explore the stats of NBA players with the help of a Shiny app. The final app we'll be building is [here](https://daattali.com/shiny/nba2018/) ([mirror](https://daattali.shinyapps.io/nba2018/))

Slides are available [here](https://github.com/daattali/shiny-workshop-odsc2019/raw/master/Shiny%20Workshop%20-%20ODSC%202019.pdf)

### Before we begin: Option 1

**Step 1:** Go to https://rstudio.cloud and sign up

**Step 2:** Go to https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/30306/join?access_code=s4hEiPXQF%2BjosPclQEzgTtR0mPWDuh7Dhr2O7wAg and click *"Join Space"*

**Step 3:** Click on *"Projects"* at the top, then click on the dropdown menu beside *"New Project"* and select *"New Project from Git Repo"*. Use this URL: https://github.com/daattali/shiny-workshop-odsc2019

That's all you need to do! Don't worry about looking at any of the material, we'll cover it all in the workshop. All you need to do is steps 1-2-3. 


#### Alternate setup instructions: Option 2

I highly recommend following the steps above for setup. The only caveat with the previous steps is that they assume that you'll have an internet connection available during the workshop. If you think you may not have internet during the workshop, then you can follow these steps for setup instead:

**Step 1:** Install the following R packages: `shiny`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `DT`, `colourpicker`, `readr`. You can use this command in R to install all these packages at once: `install.packages(c("shiny", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "DT", "colourpicker", "readr"))` 

**Step 2:** Go to https://github.com/daattali/shiny-workshop-odsc2019

**Step 3:** Click on the green button *"Clone or download"* and then click on *"Download ZIP"*. Now you have all the necessary workshop materials on your computer.
